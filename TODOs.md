#### TODOs
* write_elements_by_vertices_tetra() has 4\*ones 
has to be changed to: -np.ones( whatever , dtype=int) etc
macro_elements type 1: prisms, pyrs and tetra
macro_elements type 2: prisms
macro_elements type 3: tetra

##### Prioritary Items
2. Execution flow? $ python module.py?
3. Documentation about order and positions 
   of the vertices in each element? For example, in a pyramid is it the top always
   the _last_?
4. start overall documentation
5. choose a name for the project
6. joss?
7. cubic macroelement 0: four tetrahedral and one hybrid macroel.
8. cubic macroelement 1: tetrahedra within five tetrahedra 
9. cubic macroelement 2: two prisms
10. make tests ready to include in the installation
11. release under a license
  1. ~~Put a license notice in each file.~~
  2. startup notice.
12. sourceforge
